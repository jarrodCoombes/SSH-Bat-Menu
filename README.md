# SSH Menu for Windows

This script should work on any version of windows that has a cli SSH client installed. Windows 10 since the 2018 update has the openSSH client installed by default.

[To enable SSH on Windows 10](https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/) (this may also work for Windows Server 2012 and newer server versions).
For older versions of Windows you would need to find a working SSH client and install it somewhere in the path.
